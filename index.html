    <h2 id="What"><u></u></h2>
	       <p>GIS is one of the most valuable tools first responders have to deal with natural disasters. GIS is a method of using maps to demonstrate data which coincides greatly with natural disater help. Whether it be hurricanes, volcanos or, earthquakes we can use this information to prevent, prepare, and recover. </p>
	       <h2 id="heading"><u>Hurricanes</u></h2>
	       <h3 id="Risk Reduction"><u></u></h3>
<p>It's important to plan evacuation routes ahead of time and assess the dangers of certain locations. Hurricane Katrina, one of the most destructive hurricanes in American history, hit hardest on a warmer, coastal city. This is because these types of locations have the largest capacity for destruction and allow hurricanes to form more easily. The map below helps to show the depths of these waters after the flooding. This GIS map has the potential to be used for future coastal cities in danger of flooding. Using locations that flooded the worse, we now know what NOT to do in the case of a powerful hurricane in the future. Also, this can be used as an example for other coastal cities on what could happen if levees are outdated and preparations aren't made. </p>

<h2 id="heading"><u>Volcanos</u></h2>
 <p>Volcanos are another potentially dreadful natural disaster. The first step is to monitor these volcanos for any suspicious activity that may lead to an eventual eruption. Using GIS we can map each individual volcano and track them allowing us to respond as fast as possible with proper help. Is stands to reason that plans are made for each eruption so that responders know exactly what to do on the scene. Short term plans are then used, such as food, water shelter, etc, in order to help all displaced individuals of the natural disaster. Long term plans however require the cooperation of both responder and victims of the disaster as civilians need to know the dangers of volcanic eruptions and how to react. Below shows a list of active volcanos throughout the world.

<p>Learning about GIS was pretty boring to me at first because I never recognized just how integral it is in terms of collecting actually useful data. Natural disaster are here to stay but there are ways to minimize the damage using GIS. Also, in terms of coding it was a lot more simple and effective then I thought it to be. HTML is probably my favorite method of coding out of everything I've tried. In the future I hope to respect these sorts of topics that may seem pointless more and try to see their everyday uses.
